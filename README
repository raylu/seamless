httpd exercise: https://www.raylu.net/httpd.txt
shell exercise: https://gist.github.com/raylu/5c6d570ae186f963ad2d

if you've done both of the above and want to write a seamlessly reloading httpd,
you've come to the right place!

provided is seamless.py, a simple, non-concurrent webserver
and tester.py, a multi-threaded http client that runs seamless.py and sends it SIGHUP

edit seamless.py to handle SIGHUP and reload its own code via os.execl
use socket.socket's fileno arg to make it seamless
https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket
if the tester runs without errors, you've either succeeded or cheated

good luck!
